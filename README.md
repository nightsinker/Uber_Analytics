The primary focus of our exploration centers on dissecting Uber's data analysis methodologies, unveiling the nuances of cost-effective driver assignments and strategic dynamic pricing. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset from Uber and Lyft rides in Boston, Massachusetts (MA), spanning two months, our objective is to distill actionable insights that extend beyond immediate applications.

This foray into data-driven decision-making seeks not only to demystify the operational fabric of Uber but also to provide broader insights into the evolving dynamics of rideshare data.
